PROJECT GOAL
	The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset on [data.world](https://data.world/). All analysis should be performed in a single Jupyter notebook and all data, documentation, and code should be published in a single GitHub link repository. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate that I can follow best practices for open scientific research in designing and implementing my project, and make my project fully reproducible by others: from data collection to data analysis.
