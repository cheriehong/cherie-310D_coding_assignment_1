<h3>PROJECT GOAL</h3>
<body>
The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset on https://data.world/. All analysis should be performed in a single Jupyter notebook and all data, documentation, and code should be published in a single GitHub link repository. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate that I can follow best practices for open scientific research in designing and implementing my project, and make my project fully reproducible by others: from data collection to data analysis.
