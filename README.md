<h3>PROJECT GOAL</h3>
<body>
The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset on https://data.world/. All analysis should be performed in a single Jupyter notebook and all data, documentation, and code should be published in a single GitHub link repository. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate that I can follow best practices for open scientific research in designing and implementing my project, and make my project fully reproducible by others: from data collection to data analysis.

<h3>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h3>

<body>
Potential biases/issues to this data is that is was collected from Wikipedia which is publically edited. As such, it could contain human errors in the process of transferring from the original source data. Further, there could also be other errors in the process of extraction and transformation as I am not a professional and this project was conducted as an academic project.
